# MVC-Exploration
This project is meant to demonstrate a basic understanding of the MVC design pattern.

I haven't had any formal experience with working on a MVC application on a professional level, so I wanted to have something to
show to potential employers that I have a basic grasp on the model-view-controller design pattern.

Overall this project was a lot of fun, and it wasn't difficult to implement. The application I chose to create is a simple class roster application that allows the "teacher" to add and remove
students from a class roster. Of course in a real world application the model would be a lot more in depth and most likely be hooked up to a database. Likewise the controller would have a lot
more input/output to manage, and the view would be a lot more elaborate to create a nice-looking application for the user to look at.

This little project was a lot of fun and I found myself enjoying it as I worked on it. I noticed that this kind of software architecture just makes sense. Adding and removing functionality
isn't nearly as difficult as I thought it would be and if you want to change a feature you know exactly where to go. Overall this was very enjoyable!
