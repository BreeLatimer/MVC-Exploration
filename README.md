# MVC-Exploration

## Initial Thoughts
This project is meant to demonstrate a basic understanding of the MVC design pattern.

I haven't had any formal experience with working on a MVC application on a professional level, so I wanted to have something to
show to potential employers that I have a basic grasp on the model-view-controller design pattern.

Overall this project was a lot of fun, and it wasn't difficult to implement. The application I chose to create is a simple class roster application that allows the "teacher" to add and remove
students from a class roster. Of course in a real world application the model would be a lot more in depth and most likely be hooked up to a database. Likewise the controller would have a lot
more input/output to manage, and the view would be a lot more elaborate to create a nice-looking application for the user to look at.

This little project was a lot of fun and I found myself enjoying it as I worked on it. I noticed that this kind of software architecture just makes sense. Adding and removing functionality
isn't nearly as difficult as I thought it would be and if you want to change a feature you know exactly where to go. Overall this was very enjoyable!

## Update: 9/18/2023
I have decided to continue expansion on this project in order to turn it into a proper full-stack application. Going forward this project will be intended to be a demonstration of my understanding of
multiple areas of expertise; from understanding MVC as a design pattern, to database integration, to adding a more appealing front-end using React. I decided to take the time during this programming session
to add CI support along with unit testing support in order to better ensure the longevity of this project.

## Update: 9/22/2023
Transferring this application to utilize ASP.NET MVC is proving to be more difficult that I initially realized. I am considering making a separate folder for the legacy version and then attempting to take that same concept and apply it to this more full-fledged and better thought out application design.
